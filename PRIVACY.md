# Privacy Policy
Chitchatfill ("the extension") helps expand snippets, manage replies, and optionally send data to external services when you request it (The API Key is not included).

## What the extension stores locally
- Snippets, categories, and settings in chrome.storage.
- Optional API keys (OpenAI) stored locally.
- Optional reminder settings and history stored locally.

## Data the extension can access
- Active tab URL and page content to expand snippets and to auto-fill data in the Submit Spreadsheet form.

## Data sent to third parties (only when you use those features)
- OpenAI API: When you use AI paraphrase or AI assistant, the text you submit (and any context you choose to include) is sent to OpenAI at https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions using your API key.
- Google Apps Script: When you submit the spreadsheet form, the entered fields are sent to the Web App URL you configured.

## What we do not do
- We do not sell data, run analytics, or track browsing beyond what is needed to provide the features.

## Your control
- You can delete snippets, clear history, remove API keys, or uninstall the extension to remove local data.
